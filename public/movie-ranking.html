The Best Movies According to Juan
</h1>
<h2>
My top 3 movies of all-time
</h2>
<hr />
<h3>
Fractured
</h3>
<p>
Is a really nice movie, I didn't expect the ending
</p>
<h3>
A Fall From Grace
</h3>
<p>
In short, it’s nuts. And while it’s available to watch at home through streaming,
it’s the kind of movie that’ll be way more enjoyable with an audience because there
are so many opportunities to scream at the screen, especially as the movie reaches 
its twisty, increasingly insane climax.

<h3>
Toy Story 4
</h3>
<p>
I just like a lot all toy story movies hahaha. I'll drop a poem:
</p>
<h4>
<p>
In a child’s room, dreams take flight,<br/>
Plastic hearts that glow at night.<br/>
friendship lasts, through joy and strife,<br/>
Toys give love, and love gives life.<br/>
</p>
</h4>
