<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Juan, originally from Venezuela and now based in the Netherlands. I like to describe myself as a curious and open-minded person, always exploring new experiences and finding ways to connect with people. Living abroad has taught me to adapt quickly, appreciate different cultures, and carry a little piece of home with me wherever I go.</p>

<p>I’ve spent most of my career working in hospitality, which has given me the chance to meet people from all over the world and develop a real sense of service. Recently, I decided to step into a new field — the spa world. I started as a host, and now I’m training in massage, learning the basics and discovering a whole new side of helping others feel good. It’s been a challenge, but also a perfect way to grow while staying true to my love of learning new things.</p>

<p>At the same time, I’ve started diving into something that has always caught my attention: programming. Exploring tech and learning how to build things from scratch has been both exciting and rewarding, and I see it as another path where I can challenge myself, stay creative, and keep expanding my skills for the future.</p>
